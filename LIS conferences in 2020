Instructional Design and Practice
A.6.a: The digital humanities (DH) remain a growing area of interest among researchers and locus of new positions within libraries, archives, museums, 
       and cultural heritage organizations. In response to this demand, many library and information science (LIS) programs have developed curricula around DH. 
       While previous studies have surveyed DH programs, courses, and instructors generally, none has systematically examined DH courses within the context of LIS. 
       This paper analyzes courses offered within ALA-accredited programs and iSchools, presenting descriptive findings, exploring unique aspects of DH education within LIS, 
       and contextualizing courses offered in the United States and Canada with other courses worldwide.
